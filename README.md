Whether it's:
- Creamy **carbonara**
- Zesty **arrabbiata**
- Earthy **pesto trofie**
- Or just buttered noodles at 2 AM...

Pasta never asks questions.  
Pasta understands.  
Pasta waits patiently in boiling water to become its true self — and so do we.

## 📝 Deep Thoughts (while boiling water)

- Pasta is proof that simplicity can be divine.
- There's no such thing as "too much Parmesan."
- If life gives you lemons, make lemon linguine.

This profile doesn’t push code. It pulls carbs.
